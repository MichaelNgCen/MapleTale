# MapleTale: 2D Platform Game 🍁

### Description
MapleTale is a 2D Platform Game inspired by my favorite game growning up, Maplestory. MapleStory, is a free-to-play, 2D, side-scrolling massively multiplayer online role-playing game. In the game, players travel the "Maple World", defeating monsters and developing their characters' skills and abilities as is typical in role-playing games. Players can interact with others in many ways, including chatting and trading. Groups of players can band together in parties to hunt monsters and share rewards, and can also form guilds to interact more easily with each other. Players additionally have the option to visit the in-game "Cash Shop" to purchase a variety of character appearances or gameplay enhancements with real money. The goal of MapleTale is to move our main character around the screen, kill the monsters and collect the loot that they drop. Check out game's instructions for more information!
